# React Starter Kit

# REACT test

This website is an element of assessment of Adalab web development bootcamp.
In order to show my command of REACT, I have created this website that allows the user to search characters of Harry Potter in an API. The search results are displayed in a list that allows the user to clik each card in order to save series as favourites.
Each character's card is clickable and when clicked, shows further information on the character.
In order to portray Spanish language gender, variables have been introduced in elements, such as the species.
